## 1.1.1

- Add `docile` dependency `< 1.4.0`
- Relax `pry` dependency range from `~> 0.10.4` to `~> 0.10`

## 1.1.0

- Allow puppetlabs_spec_helper 3.0.0 and later

## 1.0.2

- Ensure that only compatible pathspec versions are considered on older ruby versions

## 1.0.1

- Relax `puppet_litmus` dependency range from ~> 0.21.0 to ~> 0.21

## 1.0.0

### Remove Ruby 2.1 & 2.3 dependencies
We no longer support these Ruby versions

### Move `puppet_litmus` to `system_tests`
With this we can remove the litmus dependency from unit tests - which historically has been causing dependency conflicts between `bolt`'s internals and the `puppet` gem under test. Instead [`pdk-templates`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/371) now installs `puppet_litmus` only when actually needed through the `system_tests` group.

This removes the unmaintained beaker dependencies from the gems. If you still require those, you can still use the previous `<1.0.0` gems. Please consider [upgrading](https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus/Converting-modules-to-use-Litmus.html).

### Update to newest rubocop version
With the drop of old rubies we can update to the current version of rubocop. Together with the [change of policies](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/371), there should be only very little changes required to your ruby code and `pdk validate -a` should fix the most annoying bits.
- Pins `rubocop` to 1.6.1
- Pins `rubocop-spec` to 2.0.1
- Add `rubocop-performance`

### Update tooling for ruby 2.4+
- Pull `puppet-debugger` into main section
- Pull `puppet-blacksmith` into main section
- Relax `codecov` pin
- Update `parallel_tests` pin to latest version
- Update `puppet-syntax` pin to latest version

### Remove i18n related tooling
- `gettext-setup`
- `puppet_pot_generator`
- `rubocop-i18n`

### Other cleanup
- allow newer versions of `metadata-json-lint`
- add `rb-readline` pin for windows (formerly in pdk-template's default config's Gemfile)
- remove activesupport pin where not needed
